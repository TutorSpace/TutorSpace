                How to schedule a tutoring session?
            </summary>
            <p class="fc-black-2">
                You have two ways to schedule a tutoring session. First, you can click on the “Find a Tutor” button at the top bar, and then filter your results. Second, you can schedule a session by going to the profile page of active tutors in the forum.

            <p class="fc-black-2">
                We will notify the tutor immediately once you request a tutoring session. However, we cannot guarantee the response time from the tutor. We encourage you to send multiple requests for the same time period each time to increase the possibility of a successful-booked session.

                Unfortunately, you cannot adjust your session time after you have booked a session. However, you can cancel your session and book a new one.

            <p class="fc-black-2">If your tutor is late for no more than 15 minutes. Try to negotiate with your tutor first to see if he/she can make up the missing time after the original session. If the tutor cannot or refuses to make up the time, it is your right to comment and give negative ratings to him/her.
