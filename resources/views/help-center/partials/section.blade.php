                How to schedule a tutoring session?
            </summary>
            <p class="fc-black-2">
                You have two ways to schedule a tutoring session. First, you can click on the “Find a Tutor” button at the top bar, and then filter your results. Second, you can schedule a session by going to the profile page of active tutors in the forum.

                We will notify the tutor immediately once you request a tutoring session. However, we cannot guarantee the response time from the tutor. We encourage you to send multiple requests for the same time period each time to increase the possibility of a successful-booked session.

                Tutor Growth Plan is a motivation program designed for our tutors. Users can raise their tutor levels by earning experience points on the platform. Tutors with a higher tutor level usually indicate that they are more experienced, knowledgeable, and trustworthy.

It varies in accordance with different tutor levels. As tutors move up to higher tutor levels, which indicates they become more experienced in tutoring and their academic field, they will be able to set a higher hourly rate.

                What is Tutor Verification?
            </summary>
            <p class="fc-black-2">
                Our Tutor Verification System aims to verify tutors' capability of tutoring specific courses and the authenticity of their academic information. The core reason for setting this verification process is purely to guarantee the quality of our tutoring services. Since TutorSpace requires all tutors on the platform to receive an A or A- for the courses they would like to tutor, the tutor verification process helps us determine which tutors are truly qualified for their positions.

                How many courses are needed to be verified in order to become a verified tutor?
            </summary>
            <p class="fc-black-2">
                Tutors are considered as verified when at least one course they want to be tutor gets successfully verified. A unique badge will appear next to the user's name when they become a verified tutor.

                Does verified tutors mean that all the courses they teach are verified?
            </summary>
            <p class="fc-black-2">
                The answer is NO. Verified tutors and verified courses are two different concepts. Tutors are labeled as verified when at least one course they want to tutor is verified (must have an A-/A in that course). It is possible that some other courses they teach are not verified by TutorSpace. Verified courses are distinguished by the yellow badge near the course name.

            <p class="fc-black-2">
                Turos will get a notification when we confirm to receive their tutor verification requests, which will probably take place in 24 hours since the submission of materials. Please allow another 48 hours to get the final result, whether the information is successfully verified or not.

                Do tutors have to re-verify their academic information if they add/remove any courses they want to tutor?
            </summary>
            <p class="fc-black-2">
                No, there is no need for tutors to re-submit their materials for another verification. Tutors’ academic information will be stored safely in our database, and our system will automatically verify their course lists if some changes are made.
