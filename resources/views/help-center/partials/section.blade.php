                How to schedule a tutor session?
            </summary>
            <p class="fc-black-2">
                There are two ways to schedule a tutor session. First, you can click on the “Find a Tutor” button at the top bar and, meanwhile, filter your results. Second, you can also schedule a session by going to the profile page of active tutors in the forum.

            <summary>I have submitted a tutor request; how long will it take me to receive a response?</summary>
            <p class="fc-black-2">Tutors will be notified immediately once you submit a tutoring session request successfully. However, we can not guarantee the response time since each tutor varies. We encourage you to send multiple requests for the same time period each time to increase the possibility of a successful-booked session.

            </summary>
            <p class="fc-black-2">Unfortunately, based on our current functionality, No. If you still feel unlikely to take a particular session, you can cancel the session within a reasonable period and book another one.

            <p class="fc-black-2">This depends on a lot of factors and needs investigation, and you also need to notify your tutor about your situation so that they will not waste their time waiting for you.   According to our Cancellation Policy, student users can usually be allowed to cancel their sessions at least 12 hours away from their tutoring sessions. You will not be granted a full refund if you cancel your session when there are less than 12 hours to your session.

            <p class="fc-black-2">TutorSpace takes the attendance of our registered tutors very seriously. If your tutor is late for more than 15 minutes for your session, we would define it as a “Tutor Not Show-Up” session. In this case, please go directly to the Help Center at the top bar and click on the “Report” section button. Please type in all the necessary information to help us know thoroughly about your situation and then click on the submit button. TutorSpace’s staff will contact you within 24 hours.

                Note: you may still be auto-charged for the Tutor Not Show-Up session, but we will arrange a full refund for you after we have a full understanding of your situation.

            <p class="fc-black-2">TutorSpace defines your session as Tutor Show-Up Late when your tutor is late for no more than 15 minutes. Try to negotiate with your tutor first to see if he or she can make up the missing time after the original session. If the tutor cannot or refuses to make up the time, it is your right to comment and give negative ratings to him or her.

            <p class="fc-black-2">This is up to the tutor. We think a tutoring session with multiple students would be beneficial for both tutors and students. For students, they can split the bill to save some money. For tutors, it increases the chance of being invited as a tutor since each student pays less.

To market your profile, we strongly recommend you to be active in our forum by telling people your past class experience, sharing class notes, and answering other students’ questions so that more people will notice you.
